This increase continues at the 7th (1d8), 11th (1d10) and 17th (2d6) levels. When you hit a creature with your Claws, if the target is a creature other than a Construct, Plant, Undead, or Ooze, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Blood Feature DC or be Paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a success, it is immune to your Paralytic Claws for 24 hours.</content>

During this Frenzy, you gain the following benefits: Choose one: You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, or you have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Frenzied Strikes: When you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can decide to throw caution to the wind, biting and scratching relentlessly. Doing so gives you advantage on unarmed strike attack rolls during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. When you drop a creature to zero hit points, you can make an additional unarmed strike against another creature within your range as part of your Attack action. This can be your Bite attack, ignoring the normal restrictions for your Bite. Your Frenzy lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your Frenzy on your turn as a bonus action.</content>
